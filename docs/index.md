# EditR

EditR is an algorithm for predicting potential editing in a guide RNA region from a single Sanger sequencing run. This allows users to estimate base editing efficiency quicker and cheaper than using deep sequencing. 

  

It consists of the algorithm implemented in the R statistical programming language and provided as a Shiny app built to make this algorithm easy to use.

## Using the Shiny App

  

You can use the R Shiny App in two ways: through and instance on shinyapps.io, or installing it locally on your computer. We recommend testing it out on shinyapps.io, and then installing it locally to do a lot of analysis with.

  

### Testing it out on shinyapps.io

We have an instance on shinyapps.io here. If it’s not working, it’s likely that we used up our usage for the month, and you will have to install EditR locally. 

  

### Installing EditR locally
 

1. [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [R Studio (desktop version)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) 
2. Download code from github repository, and unzip into a directory you want to work from 
3. Open R Studio and run the code in dependencies.R to install the packages required 
4. In R Studio, open server.R, and click the run app button 
5. ???? 
6. PROFIT
